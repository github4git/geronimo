Release Notes
===================

 Please read the RELEASE_NOTES for a complete list of things that are
 not yet functional.  We wrote those up to save you time trying to get
 things to work we know are not implemented.

 
___________________
安装
===================

 If you've downloaded and unpacked a binary distribution of Geronimo,
 then you are finished with installation.  You can also use the
 installer JAR to customize things like network ports and the
 administrative login during installation.

 
___________________
Geronimo 官网
===================
 
 The GERONIMO_HOME directory, is the directory where the Geronimo
 binary was unpacked or the it is the 'target' directory created by
 Maven from a source distribution.
 
 If you unpacked the binary into the directory C:\geronimo,
 for example, than this directory is your GERONIMO_HOME directory.
 The GERONIMO_HOME directory is referred to in various parts of the
 documentation, so it's good to remember where it is.


___________________
启动
===================

 The main server class is also packed in an executable jar,
 bin/server.jar, and can be ran in a way similar to the deploy tool.

   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\server.jar

 Once the server has started, you can access the welcome page by
 pointing your browser to:

   http://localhost:8080/
   
 You can also visit the web management console at:
 
   http://localhost:8080/console/
   
 To access the console, use the administrative account, which is
 username "system" and password "manager" by default.
   

___________________
部署
===================

 The Geronimo deployment tool is packaged in the executable jar
 bin/deployer.jar under the GERONIMO_HOME and can be executed like
 this (assuming the server is already running):

   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar deploy myDataSource.rar
   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar deploy myEJB.jar
   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar deploy myWebapp.war
   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar deploy myApp.ear

 Notice that the deployer.jar is capable of handling a number of
 different archive types; rar, war, ejb jar, and EAR.

 The deployer will prompt you for a username and password; the
 default administrative account has username "system" and password
 "manager".
